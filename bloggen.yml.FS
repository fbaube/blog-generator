# bloggen.yml
# Important notes: 
# 1) The "bloggenator" executable loads this file from its CWD 
#    (current working directory), and therefore "bloggenator" 
#    must be run from the directory that this file is in. This 
#    constrains relative file URLs in this file to be relative
#    to the directory of this file.
# 2) YAML itself is a mess, so this file keeps it simple by using
#    only one (top) level of properties and only a single value 
#    for each property. For a property that actually need to have 
#    multiple values, enclose all of the values within a pair of 
#    single quotes and separate the values by spaces.
# 3) Based on (2) above, these properties can all be read into a 
#    map[string]string - at least until any property with multiple 
#    values has to be unpacked with strings.Split(propstring," ")
#    - which greatly simplifies processing, and makes it simple to
#    add new properties.
